# Building

Use these instructions to run Word Peril from the repository. These should
work in nearly all cases.

## Running from Source

First, make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your machine.

The included setup.py and Makefile mean you can run the game directly from
this repository. On any system that supports Makefiles, simply run:

```
make run
```

That command will create the virtual environment, install the game, and run it.

Alternatively, you can create your own Python 3.8 (or later) virtual
environment and install the game by running the following from within
the root of the repository:

```
/path/to/your/venv/pip install .
```
